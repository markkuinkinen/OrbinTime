This is a solo project that I made as a project for school, and I gotta say, it was a lot of fun to create but rather difficult as I wasn't as organised from the start as I should have been. I had a general idea of what I wanted to do, that being a top-down style game, and had purchased assets that fit that idea. It started off rather small and then become quite large and overwhelming, especially with me making a large change midway through when deciding to put everything within the game in the same scene (minus the intro/credits scene). Not having a solid plan for what I was going to do meant that I had to rewrite a lot of code that I wouldn't have had to do otherwise. In the future I'll definitely have a more thought out plan before diving into a project which will hopefully mean that I can better optimise my scripts as well as my work flow. I've learnt a lot from creating this game and it won't be the last game I create either, and with the skills I picked up making this I'm sure my next game will be even better.
