## About

**Orbin Time** is a top-down **2D** game built in **Unity**, featuring pixel art environments and real-time player movement. What began as a small idea quickly evolved into a larger and more complex project, becoming an incredible learning experience in the process.

This game was made entirely solo—from design and implementation to debugging and deployment—as part of a school project.  
Despite the hurdles and mistakes along the way, it taught me a lot about game development, especially planning, scripting, and scope management.


##  Gameplay
The game is centered around real-time exploration in a pixel-art world. Originally planned as a compact project, it grew to feature:

-   A single-scene game world (excluding intro/credits scenes)
    
-   Item collection and interaction
    
-   Challenging navigation
    
-   Top-down controls
    

> In the future, I aim to expand on player combat and enemy AI mechanics.

##  Development Challenges

### Planning & Scope

One of the main lessons I learned was the **importance of planning**. A loose idea without a solid structure led to a lot of **rewriting**, especially after I decided to merge most of the game into a single scene mid-development.

###  Code Structure

Another major challenge was maintaining **clean and organized code**:

-   Some scripts became bloated, like `PlayerController`, which ended up managing way too many responsibilities.
    
-   I discovered **script inheritance** late into development. Using base classes for shared functionality would have drastically improved reusability and readability.
    

### Assets & Limitations

All visual assets were sourced from a **Unity asset pack**, as I'm not a pixel artist myself. Limitations included:

-   A lack of enemy animations (no attack or death sprites), which restricted combat implementation.
    
-   Difficulty finding fitting **music and SFX** that matched the game's tone.
    

In the future, I'd love to work in a **multidisciplinary team**, where each member brings their own expertise—especially in areas like art and audio.

## What I Learned

-   The value of **organization and planning**
    
-   How to **break up responsibilities across scripts**
    
-   The basics of **script inheritance** and its benefits
    
-   Better workflow habits for future projects
    
-   That I really enjoy making games—and I’ll definitely be making more
